# About json_processing script

This is python script which can be used as console user interface program or python module to perform some usefull manipulation with JSON data.

# Features
Goal is to handle several usefull things for text JSON representaion which can be considered as hierarchical representaion of data:

[1] extract some variable from JSON object by path

[2] extract some variable from JSON object by path and evaluated arbitarily Python expression on this variable. To reference to variable use "value" in your expression

[3] delete some variable from JSON object by path

[4] set some variable to specific value if previously variable was contained within JSON object

[5] set some variable to specific value if previously variable was not contained within JSON object

# Input format

Input is reading from stdin as it's a textfile in format:

`<USER_DEFINED_KEY> <TAB> <JSON_REPRESENTATION> <LF>`

`<USER_DEFINED_KEY> <TAB> <JSON_REPRESENTATION> <LF>`

`...`
 Â 

`<TAB>` -- is tab symbol

`<LF>` -- is line feeding, a.k.a new line.

So before use this script you should convert text representation of JSON object into representation which doesn't include line feeding.
